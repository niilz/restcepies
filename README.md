# restcepies
THIS REPO IS NOT YET FINISHED AT ALL. (Kind of my first try)

once it is done the app should give out recepies with ingredients,
- based on given (already existing) ingredients in the fridge, house, bunker, etc.
- highlighting the ingredients that are not yet named (the missing pieces/the REST).

- The Restcepies should be sorted in the way that the ones with the least amount of missing ingredients are listed first.
(This aimes to immediately see if something / what has to be shopped to complete the recepies in questions, inspired by the stuff that was already in the house anyway)
